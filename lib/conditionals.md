# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are used in code to produce a predefined solution given a user input or 
a value for a variable. If someone has multiple solutions to a problem and want
to create one file to produce each solution, then conditionals are needed.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single equality is used to define/assign a variable to a value. From my experience
whenever I need to loop a code a specific number of times, then I will use i = 0
to start and at the end of each completed loop the equation i = i + 1 will increase
i by 1.

A double equality is used when a true or false value is part of the code. Using 
the above scenario, if the needed number of loops is 10, then the block of code
running the loop will begin as if i == 10 then the code will stop, elseif the 
code will continue to loop.
